<!-- ひさびさに二郎系ラーメンを食べた

石川県に戻ってきてから初めて二郎系のラーメンを食べた。

正確には二郎ではなく、二郎インスパイアのラーメンだが。

750円でプチ、800円で小なのだが、今回はプチサイズを選んだ。

プチサイズでも十分量があるのでかなりお腹がいっぱいになった。

ニンニクの量を聞かれたときに、「多めで」と言ってしまったので、少し辛くなってしまって辛かった。

This was the first time I had Jiro-style ramen since I came back to Ishikawa.

(Technically, though, it's not Jiro, it's Jiro-**inspired** ramen.)

They have a petite size for 750 yen and a small size for 800 yen, but I chose the petite size this time.

Even though petite size ramen made me quite full.

When the waiter asked me how much garlic I wanted, I said "more" and it was hard because it was a little spicy. 😖
