<!--
ウェイトブランケットを買った

ウェイトブランケットという、めちゃくちゃ重い掛け布団を買いました。

どうやら睡眠の質に影響するのはベッドではなく掛け布団ということで、前から気になっていたのですが購入はしていなかったので思い切って買ってみたという感じです。

第一印象としては、まぁ重い(笑)。重さが6.8kgということでかなり重いです。布団を広げるのも一苦労でした。

実際に寝るときに使ってみた感じは、やはり重すぎて自然と笑ってしまいました。かなり体が包み込まれている感覚があります。結構違和感があったので、慣れるまで時間がかかりそうです。

一晩過ごした感想としては、たしかに寝起きはいいような気はするもののまだわからないな、という感じでした。今後に期待です。

I bought a weighted blanket, an **insanely** heavy blanket.

Apparently, it's the comforter, not the bed mat, that affects the quality of sleep, so I've been curious about it for a while, but I hadn't purchased it, so I took the plunge and bought it.

My first impression is that it's quite heavy, lol. It weighs 6.8kg, which is pretty heavy. It was hard to unfold this.

The actual feeling of using it to sleep was still so heavy that I naturally laughed at it. 😂 It feels pretty much like my body is wrapped up in it. It was quite uncomfortable, so it will take some time to get used to it.

After spending a night with it, I felt like I was getting a good night's sleep, but I'm not sure yet. I'm hoping that using this will improve the quality of my sleep in the future.😤
