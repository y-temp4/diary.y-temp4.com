ハンドソープの詰め替えボトルとして、無印良品の詰替ボトル（泡タイプ）を購入しました。

普段使いのハンドソープを何にするかはこれまで少し悩んでいたのですが、極力無添加のものが良いと思っていました。

そこで、今使っている洗濯用洗剤があまり添加物が入っていないタイプのものだったので、これをハンドソープとしても利用することにしました。

この洗濯用洗剤のレビューを見ても、ハンドソープや洗顔料など他の用途として使っているというものが多かったので、おそらく問題はないと思います。

レビューの中に、無印良品の詰替ボトルを使うと良いですよ、というものがあったので、これに従って購入を決めました。

実際、使ってみるといい感じで泡が出てくるので良さそうです。ただ、使うときは水で薄める必要がありますが、水の量を間違えて少なめにしてしまいました。なので容器に入れてから少し後悔しました。

次はもっと薄めようと思います。🚰

I bought a refillable bottle (foam type) from [MUJI](https://www.muji.com/) to refill my hand soap.

I'd been struggling a little bit with what to use for my everyday hand soap. I've always wanted to make sure it was as additive-free as possible.

So I decided to use my current laundry detergent as a hand soap as well, since it is the type of laundry detergent that doesn't have many additives in it.

Many of the reviews of this laundry detergent said that it was used for other purposes, such as hand soap and facial cleanser, so it's probably not a problem.

One of the reviews said that you can use a refillable bottle from MUJI, so I decided to follow this and buy it.

In fact, it looks good because it bubbles up nicely when I use it. However, when you use it, you need to dilute it with water, but I put the wrong amount of water and used less. And I regretted it a bit.

Next time I'm going to dilute it more.🚰
